# Overall Overview

  Simple game of Tic Tack Toe.

  The document is divided into the global variable objects and the DOM manipulation.

  The basic idea of the global variables is to set the game, store the final check for the variations.

  The


## What I learned

  - Ask lots of questions. Ask them early and get help to get going rather than battling through.
  Turn to the others for help. They are going to be one of the biggest tool for the coming weeks.

  - Put all global variables in objects. Use jquery to reference these as you go.

  - Divide the code into two sections. The global variables (these should be in an object) so they don't float in code and possibly be changed.

  - If you are repeating yourself, you can probably find a way to write it in one line of code.



## What I would do differently

  - Pseudo on pseudo. Find how the pseudo is going to work and then work out all the different functions I will have to write code for. Figure out what has to be put in the DOM, what has to be put.

  - Plan out the code. Not just PSEUDO code but literally see how the code will be set out so I know where things have to go back and forth between.

  - Change the way I approach the problem. Work with others to ask questions and try to work together for a final result.




## What does success in the future look like



## bugs
   It seems that the basic functions of the game are working.
   I need to keep building on what on the presentation, animations and see if it is possible to tackle AI.

## libraries used

  Used the following codepen to help me nail the theme down.

## People who helped

  Big shout out to Max. He was a massive help when Edgy and Luke were busy or not present.
  Also the name of the game is thanks to James Nugent aka Nugget. I promised him I would give him credit.
