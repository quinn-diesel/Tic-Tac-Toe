// Overview
//
// Let's start out with something fun - a game!
//
// We'll be making Tic Tac Toe, a game that takes seconds to learn but minutes to master! Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough programming challenges to get your feet wet in the world of web development.
//
// "hand me your phone," load up the game, and play a quick round!
// You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!


//Big Goals

// Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
// Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
// Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
// Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
// Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete
// Craft a readme.md file that explains your app to the world

// Technical Requirements
//
// Your app must:
//
// Render a game board in the browser
// Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
// Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
// Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
// Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
// Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
// Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
// Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

//Necessary Deliverables
//
// A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
// A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repo
// A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
// A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

// set up the object that is going to be accessed when the players interact with the game
// the logic behind the game is going
// the result coming DOM is going to dictate how the players are going to be interacting with the game

//nOtes
//want to make it a magic square
//first player to 15 wins

//GLOBAL VARIABLES
